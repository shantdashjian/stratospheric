## About Stratospheric

With Stratospheric, we teach you everything you need to know to get your Spring Boot application into production with AWS.

Throughout the project, we incrementally build a real-world Spring Boot application with a focus on the following topics:

**Infrastructure As Code**:

Say goodbye to long and hard-to-maintain CloudFormation YAML files. We're using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) and Java to express our infrastructure needs.

**Integrate Various AWS Services**:

We integrate various AWS services by implementing features for the sample application. You'll learn how to bootstrap, work with, and integrate: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL), Amazon ECS (Fargate), Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS, Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Cognito, Amazon MQ, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, etc.

**Automated Deployment**:

We start right from the beginning with an automated CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to get our changes deployed to production in a matter of minutes.

**Seamless Operation**:

We don't stop here. Once our application is running in production, things are getting serious. You'll learn how to monitor and operate a Spring Boot application in production effectively.

## Testimonials

Ricardo Sueiras (Principal Advocate at AWS):

> If you are a Spring Boot developer and looking to explore how to deploy your applications onto AWS, then you need to check out this book. The authors have put together a well thought out and easy to follow book that walks you through the typical use cases you will need. Perfect for beginners and an invaluable reference guide for those more experienced, they continue to add new content to this book and I cannot say enough great things about it.

Dennis Traub (Advocate at AWS):

> One of the most-frequent questions I get from developers is how they can get started with AWS without having to first learn and understand all the details of the hundreds of available services. In their book, Tom, Philip, and Björn do an excellent job, initially focusing on just a few basic services to quickly get you started. Once your application is up and running, you gradually add additional capabilities, like continuous integration, monitoring, alerting, and automated incident response.

Andreas Wittig (AWS Consultant and Co-Author of Amazon Web Services in Action):

> Björn, Philip, and Tom do a great job on teaching how to build a Java application on AWS. I highly recommend the book to Java developers. The book uses modern AWS services, that are ready for production workloads, and avoids the bleeding edge. The examples show how to bundle your app into a container image and deploy it with ECS and Fargate, which I highly appreciate, that the book even covers monitoring and creating a deployment pipeline.
